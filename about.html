                <p>I am a recent graduate of Virginia Tech with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering. I have experience working with everything from Web API's to embedded systems. My diverse background across a wide range of problems allows me to approach issues in a pragmatic way.</p>

                <h5>Intern</h5>
                <p>Over the summer working for Muxy, I learned not just how to work in a professional development enviornment but I was exposed to web API's for the first time. I was tasked to work on the Twtich Cheer functionality as well as DARPA contracts. These projects required the usage of GO, Swift, JavaScript, and HTML/CSS.</p>

                <h3>Booz Allen Hamilton</h3>
                <h5>Intern</h5>
                <p>My summer of Booz had me placed on a team spread out across the US which was tasked with expanding upon the AVATAR personal Ontology which the US Army was developing. Over the course of the summer, the team worked together virtually using Agile development techniques in order to both expand upon the ontology and to write software use cases for it. These uses cases required us to develop in the React/Redux libraries of JavaScript.</p>
